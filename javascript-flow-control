//in this project, we will create a magic 8 ball 
//using control flow, we will be able to predict the future of a user

//first, lets create a variable for the user
let userName = "Cliff"

//now, lets create a welcome message for our new user
//if the user doesn't provide their name, we will deliver a simple: "Hello!"
if (userName) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${userName}!`)
} else {
  console.log("Hello!")
}

//we will now save the user's question to a variable
//once the user has provided their question, we will respond with a summary message
let userQuestion = "Will I get the big job this month?"
console.log(`${userName} would like to know: "${userQuestion}"`)

//in order for us to know which response to provide, we need to generate a random number between 1 and 8
let randomNumber = Math.ceil((Math.random() * 8));

//lets create a variable for our empty eight ball and give it an empty string that we will fill depending on the random number that we receive
let eightBall = "";

//this is where the magic happens

switch(randomNumber){
  case 1:
    eightBall = 'It is certain';
    break
  case 2:
  	eightBall = 'it is decidedly so';
    break
  case 3:
  	eightBall = 'Reply hazy try again';
    break
  case 4:
  	eightBall = 'Cannot predict now';
    break
  case 5:
  	eightBall = 'Do not count on it';
    break
  case 6:
  	eightBall = 'My sources say no';
    break
  case 7:
  	eightBall = 'Outlook not so good';
    break
  case 8:
  	eightBall = 'Signs point to yes';
    break
}

//it is important to be able to solve a problem in multiple ways.
//here we will create the same type of control flow by using if/else if/else
//remove the comments below to use this code:
/*
if (randomNumber === 1) {
  eightBall = 'It is certain';
} else if (randomNumber === 2) {
  eightBall = 'it is decidedly so';
} else if (randomNumber === 3) {
  eightBall = 'Reply hazy try again';
} else if (randomNumber === 4) {
  eightBall = 'Cannot predict now';
} else if (randomNumber === 5) {
  eightBall = 'Do not count on it';
} else if (randomNumber === 6) {
  eightBall = 'My sources say no';
} else if (randomNumber === 7) {
  eightBall = 'Outlook not so good';
} else if (randomNumber === 8) {
  eightBall = 'Signs point to yes';
}
*/



//now, we need to create a message stating the answer to the user's question, depending on the Magic Eight Ball's predicton

console.log(`The Magic Eight Ball says: "${eightBall}"`)
