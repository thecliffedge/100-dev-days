#the purpose of this simple project is to demonstrate the use of python lists

#this is an old gradebook variable that I will use at the end of this project
last_semester_gradebook = [("politics", 80), ("latin", 96), ("dance", 97), ("architecture", 65)]

#here are the two lists that will be added into my gradebook list
subjects = ["physics", "calculus", "poetry", "history"]
grades = [98, 97, 85, 88]

#let's add another class
grades.append(100)
subjects.append("computer science")

#combine subjects and grades into a single list 
gradebook = list(zip(subjects, grades))

#let's add another class
gradebook.append(("visual arts", 93))

#let's see if it worked...
print(list(gradebook))

#let's combine that with an older list 
full_gradebook = list(zip(gradebook, last_semester_gradebook))

#...lets see how that looks
print(list(full_gradebook))
